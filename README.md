# VisualMassifDiff
Visualisation and Diff tool for Valgrind's Massif tool

This tool reads data files generated by Valgrind's Massif tool, possibly multiple such files, and visualises the data in them. It can also visualise a difference between two memory snapshots in such files. It is also available for other platforms, such as Windows, despite Valgrind being unavailable for those.
